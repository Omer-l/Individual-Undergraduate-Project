Welcome to Middlesex! 
Welcome from the Executive Dean 
 
Welcome  to  Middlesex  University  and  to  The  Faculty  of  Science  and  Technology.  This 
programme handbook contains an overview of your programme and its modules – keep it safe 
so that you may refer to it throughout your time on the programme. 
Your  programme  handbook  along  with  other  key  documents,  such  as  the  Academic 
Regulations and the University Guide, sets out what you can expect from your experience at 
Middlesex University but also what is expected from you.  From our side we will aim to deliver 
the best student experience we can so that you can build on your skills and knowledge and 
achieve your full potential.  In return we expect you to engage actively in the learning process, 
to be fully committed to your studies and determined to succeed. 
To read more about what your responsibilities may be you should refer to the full University 
Regulations and in particular ‘University Membership’ (mdx.ac.uk/regulations).  
In your early weeks you are not expected to absorb everything in detail but to be aware of key 
documents and their content.  If you have not already done so, have a look at the University 
Guide  and  explore UniHub (unihub.mdx.ac.uk) the student  website  which  contains  detailed 
advice and support to assist you further. 
We know it takes time to settle in to University life.  If you have questions to ask your first port 
of  call  should  be https://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/support which  offers  face-to-face,  email  and 
telephone information and advice seven days a week.  The UniHelp desk is located on the 
Ground Floor of the Sheppard Library and the advisors there will be pleased to help and direct 
you. 
Here at Middlesex we are very proud of our academic programmes and students and we look 
forward to working with you.

Personal Tutor  
You will be assigned a member of the programme team as your personal tutor. They will 
contact you via email and introduce themselves to you in person at the beginning of Term. 
Your personal tutor will normally meet you once each Term during your programme and 
you can make further appointments or contact them if you have any concerns about your 
course.  
 
Graduate Academic Assistants (GAAs)  
There are a number of GAAs who work with the BSc Computer Science programme. GAAs 
are recent Middlesex graduates who work with your tutors to assist in both  teaching  and 
supporting you. For example they may run drop in session to give advice on your assignments 
and revision as well as providing technical support during project work or tutorials. They do 
not mark your assessment or provide you with feedback on your progress. 
Student Learning Assistants (SLAs) 
You also have access to the BSc Computer Science  SLAs who are experienced and capable 
second  and  third  year  students  who  have  ‘been  there’  and  know  the  typical  academic 
problems new students face. You will not be taught by an SLA but they will work with your 
lecturers to support you both in the classroom and outside and in small groups or one to one 
sessions. You can find out who your SLAs are and information on becoming one on UniHub: 
https://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/study/student-to-student-support 
Subject Liaison Librarian 
Vanessa Hill is your Liaison Librarian. They work closely with BSc Computer Science staff to 
ensure the resources and support that you need is available and provides information and 
research  skills  workshops  relevant  to  Computing  Science.  You  can  contact  them  if  you 
require individual support or if you would like to suggest a book, DVD etc for the library.

Academic Writing and Language Co-Ordinator 
 
Dr. Paula Bernaschina is your Academic Writing & Language Coordinator. They will provide 
academic support to you in areas such as writing essays and reports, giving presentations 
and participating in academic discussions. They will work with you in seminars; you can also 
contact them for individual support.

Progression and Support Advisors 
Progression and Support Advisors work with Faculties to help students progress with their 
studies. You may be referred to a Progression and Support Advisor by a member of 
academic staff or other support service when appropriate, to support you through your 
studies. Progression and Support Advisors are able to assist with: 
 A change of personal circumstance (for example a period of illness or bereavement) 
 Understanding your progression through the programme, within University and 
programme regulations - Progression Enquiry Form 
 Changing your programme - Request changes to studies form 
 Withdrawing from studies (either temporarily or permanently) - Request to Withdraw 
form 
 Changing your mode of study - Request changes to studies form 
 Navigating and accessing other support services where students’ have complex 
and/or severe and ongoing support needs. 
 
Your Programme 
There are a number of activities built into the first year of your University experience to 
enable you to focus upon and understand your own learning and development and help you 
to progress to the second year and achieve good results.  
  
During week 4 you will participate in an activity we call ‘Progress Review’.  This focuses 
on your initial few weeks at Middlesex and is an opportunity for all students on your 
Programme to share these experiences and raise any questions or issues with the 
programme team.   
   
By week 9 you will have settled into your programme of study and received some 
assessment feedback.  At this point you will have a ‘Programme Progress Review’ which 
will be a one-to-one discussion with a member of the programme team, to talk about your 
progress and achievement to date, academic progress and future aims.  
  
A further opportunity for such a one-to-one discussion will be provided around week 18 
when you will review your progression and achievement to date and identify and plan to 
meet any specific needs and enable fulfilment of your future aims.  
  
It may be useful for you to familiarise yourself with the university’s academic calendar to see 
where these activities fit in within the university year. The calendar can be accessed on the 
My Middlesex pages of UniHub: http://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/mdx/calendar/index.aspx  
  
Please refer to the FIRST YEAR STUDENT HANDBOOK on myLearning for detailed 
information on your first year of study.

Programme Specification 
Your Programme Specification can be found at 
https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/computer-science 
Your Module 
Modules  you  are  currently registered  for  are  listed  within  the  My  Learning  area  on  the My 
Study page of myUniHub; https://myunihub.mdx.ac.uk/web/home-community/mystudy. 
You can access associated learning materials (e.g. lecture notes), reading lists, information 
on  the  learning  aims  and  outcomes  and  assessment  methods  as  well  the  schedule  for 
assessment which will include submission deadlines. 
Modules announcements will also appear in My Learning on myUniHub so log in and check 
each module regularly 
Optional modules 
Optional modules are usually available at levels 5 and 6, although optional modules are not 
offered on every course. Where optional modules are available, you  will be asked to make 
your choice during the previous academic year. If we have insufficient numbers of students 
interested in an optional module, or there are staffing changes which affect the teaching, it 
may  not  be  offered. If  an  optional  module  will  not  run,  we  will  advise  you  after the  module 
selection period when numbers are confirmed, or at the earliest time that the programme team 
make the decision not to run the module, and help you choose an alternative module.  
Programme costs 
The following course-related costs are included in the fees: 
 A free electronic core textbook for every module, 
 All printing and copying required for your study, 
 Self-service laptops available for loan for a maximum of 24 hours,

can be requested from the Programme Leader. 
Your Feedback Opportunities 
Throughout your studies at Middlesex you will be given the opportunity to provide feedback 
on your programme. Details of all the opportunities available can be found on MyUniHub.  
The main way to provide feedback is through participating in surveys, and these can be at 
module and programme level. Your feedback in surveys will be acted upon to improve your 
experience and details of where student feedback has led to change can be found on the Your 
Impact  page on MyUniHub.  
Each year of every programme is represented by a Student Voice Leader – a student who is 
elected to work with students and academics to get feedback on what is good and what needs 
improving on your course. They represent you and make students’ voices heard, collaborating 
with everyone at university to create the best possible student experience, and working with 
----------------Page (11) Break----------------

MDXSU’s President and Vice Presidents to create changes that will improve Middlesex for 
everyone. 
Programme  Voice  Groups (PVG’s) are  one  of  the  main  formal  channels  of  communication 
between staff and students.  They are a forum in which students (through the Student Voice 
Leaders) and staff can constructively discuss areas of good practice as well as areas needing 
improvement, with the collective aim of enhancing the student experience. Students and Staff 
should both be given assurances they will not be penalised for raising issues at a PVG. Full 
details can be found on MyUniHub.  
The dates of the Programme Voice Groups for 2019/20 are: 
 The Programme Voice Group meets twice each year between teaching weeks 6 and 
8 and again between weeks 17 and 19. 
Minutes and actions from previous PVG’s (formerly Boards of Study) should be made available 
to   you   through   MyUniHub.   Further   guidance   on   the PVG’s can   be   found   here: 
https://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/your-middlesex/student-feedback/  
How your Programme is Quality Assured 
You  may  have  not  heard  the  terms  'quality  assurance',  'academic  quality',  'academic 
standards' before and now you have you may think they have nothing to do with you, however 
these terms are important to you and your programme. Full details on how we do this can be 
found here.  
The Student Protection Plan 
One of the Middlesex University core values is ‘We put students first’.  We have a regulatory 
framework to support student continuation of study. The Student Protection Plan covers an 
assessment  of  the  range  of  risks  to  the  continuation  of  study  for  our  students, and  the 
measures put in place to mitigate those risks , arrangements for refund and compensation. 
Full details of the Student Protection Plan are available here

Studying or Placement Abroad 
A  study  exchange  or  a  work  placement  abroad  is  a  great  way  to  enhance  your  university 
experience  and  broaden  your  horizons.  Additionally,  taking  part  in  such  a  programme  or 
opportunity  increases  your  employability  and  supplements  the  value  of  your  degree  by 
exposing you to a new culture, different thinking and a different way of doing things.  A broad 
world view demonstrates to potential employers your ability to understand other perspectives, 
adapt to varying environments, work with diverse teams and bring an appreciation of insights 
and practices outside of your own.  
Middlesex University offers one of the most comprehensive exchange programmes in the UK.  
We  have  over  100  different  partners  within  the  European  Union  and  the  rest  of  the  world. 
Funding for some of these study and work placement opportunities may be available through 
the Erasmus+ programme. Erasmus grants are always subject to availability and to the UK’s 
ongoing participation in the Erasmus programme. 
 
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 16 
 
 
What are my exchange options? 
Currently  there  are  both  funded  exchange  options - through  the  Erasmus+  Programme (if 
available) - and  unfunded  exchange  options.  These  can  be  study  or  work  placement  (or  a 
combination of both).  These are varied and depend on your programme and capacity. Discuss 
with your Programme Leader and with the Student Exchanges Office.  
Don’t hesitate - explore your options and details can be found here. 
Middlesex Student’s Union (MDXSU) 
Your Students' Union is here to support you throughout your studies and help you make the 
most of your time at university. Powered by students, we represent student views in university 
decisions and campaign on issues that students care about. We create lots of opportunities 
for you to meet new people at a huge range of social events, develop your skills throughout 
the year, campaign for change on campus and in the community - as well as even getting a 
job with us and earning the London Living Wage! Everything we do is for students.

cannot complete an assessment. Full details of the regulations can be found here 
Research Ethics 
The following information should be made available to students, if relevant: 
An  ethical  approach  to  the  undertaking  of  teaching,  learning,  assessments  and  research 
activities is of central importance to Middlesex University. Due consideration should be given 
to ethics in all aspects of your programme. Ethical process should be followed and/or ethical 
approval sought, before you carry out any work involving human participants, human data, 
animals, materials or systems. This applies to students at all levels of their degree.   
Research ethics approval seek to ensure all work is designed and undertaken according to 
certain principles of ethical research. These include:  
1.  Primary  concern  must  be  given  to  the safety,  welfare  and  dignity of  participants, 
researchers, colleagues, the environment and the wider community  
2. Consideration of risks should be undertaken before research commences with the aim 
of  minimising  risks  to  those  involved – i.e.  human  participants  or  animal  subjects, 
colleagues, the environment and the wider community, as well as actual or potential risks 
to those directly or indirectly affected by the research. 
3. Informed consent should be freely given by participants, or by a trained person when 
collecting or analysing human tissue (details on accessing and completing online training 
for gaining informed consent for HTA purposes can be found below in Section 8). 
4. Respect for the privacy, confidentiality and anonymity of participants  
5. Consideration of the rights of people who may be vulnerable (by virtue of perceived or 
actual differences in their social status, ethnic origin, gender, mental capacities, or other 
such  characteristics) who  may  be  less  competent  or  able  to  refuse  to  give  consent  to 
participate 
 
6. Researchers have a responsibility to the general public and to their profession; as such 
they  should  balance  the  anticipated  benefits  of  their  research  against potential  harm, 
misuse or abuse which must be avoided  
7. Researchers must demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct and research 
integrity. They must work within the limits of their skills, training and experience, and refrain 
from exploitation, dishonesty, plagiarism, infringement of intellectual property rights and the 
----------------Page (16) Break----------------

fabrication  of  research  results.  They  should  declare  any  actual  or  potential  conflicts of 
interest, and where necessary take steps to resolve them.  
8. When using human tissues for research, Human  Tissue  Act  and  Human  Tissue 
Authority  (HTA)  requirements must be met. Please contact the relevant designated 
person  (DP)  in  your  department  or  the  HTA  Designated  Individual  (DI)  (Dr  Lucy  Ghali - 
L.Ghali@mdx.ac.uk). Further information is provided below in the section: "Human Tissue 
Authority Information", see 'Governance Structure" document and SOPs etc.   
9. Research should not involve any illegal activity, and researchers must comply with all 
relevant laws 
Within taught degree programmes ethical approval may have been pre-sought for research 
activities that form part of specific modules. Please check with your module tutor/your module 
guide. Note however that all students completing a dissertation or independent project 
will be required to undertake an ethical review process.   
Data  MUST  not  be  collected  without  first  obtaining  ethics  approval  for  your  research  or 
ascertaining if data gathering has been pre-approved for a module. If you submit work that 
includes data gathered from or about people without ethical approval this may be treated as 
academic misconduct and could lead to a fail grade being awarded. 
You  can  apply  for  research  ethical  approval  using  the  Middlesex  Online  Research  Ethics 
(MORE) system which has information and guidance to help you meet the highest standards 
of ethical research using this link: https://MOREform.mdx.ac.uk

Assessment 
Learning, Teaching and Assessment 
The  learning,  teaching  and  assessment  approaches  used  throughout  your  programme  will 
encourage you to be actively involved in your learning and to co-operate with other students. 
We aim to give you prompt feedback on your learning as well as opportunities to reflect upon 
and learn from that feedback.  
Learning and teaching methods 
You will be actively involved in a range of learning, teaching and assessment approaches as 
part of programme.  Such active approaches aim to put you at the centre of your learning so 
you  are  involved  and  engaged  in  all  aspects  of  your  assessment  and  learning.  Your 
programme  will  require  your  active  participation  in  learning  activities  and  engagement  with 
your  fellow  students  both  individually  and  collaboratively,  working  and  learning  with  other 
students as part of a small group. Learning activities may also occur both within and outside 
the classroom.  
----------------Page (17) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 19 
 
 
Your  learning  will  also  be  supported  by  technology.  Increasingly  your  tutors  will  be  using 
existing  and  emerging  learning  technologies  to  engage  you  in  e-learning  activities.    Your 
programme will be facilitated using a variety of media and online tools (My Learning on UniHub, 
podcasts, wikis, etc.) which will allow you flexible access to a diverse range of online resources, 
quizzes and learning materials as well as collaborative tools with which you can engage and 
learn with your peers. Not confined by the time and space associated with traditional teaching 
methods you may take part in online discussions and learning activities from wherever you 
are studying.  
Your  tutors  and  the  Web  Helpdesk  will  provide  any  support  you  may  need  whilst  learning 
online.  
By  engaging  with  e-learning  you  will  also  be  developing  skills  which  are  essential  for  your 
learning and are also highly valued by employers.  These include but are not limited to: working 
flexibly,   communication,   understanding   of   IT,   team   working   and   creating   shared 
understandings based on quality resources and access to global expertise.  
The  aims  and  objectives  of  biochemistry  modules  relate  to  developing  a  core  body  of 
knowledge, the importance of using current research based information and the evolution of 
critical and analytical skills and management of individual personal growth.  
In  order  to  facilitate  these  aims  a  wide  range  of  teaching  and  learning  strategies  will  be 
employed to meet the needs of the students.  The focus has been on encouraging students 
to be responsible for their own learning and progress.  
Lectures will be used primarily to introduce key information, concepts and theories. Seminar 
presentations  and  discussions  will  increase  knowledge  and  enable  active  participation  in 
learning.    Seminars  will  comprise  a  variety  of  formats  including  debates,  case  study  and 
problem solving analysis, student led seminars, discussions of current topics, reviewing and 
consolidating  learning  and  other  appropriate  student  activities.    Many  sessions  will  include 
informal formative  assessment.   Interactive  computer  based  sessions,  laboratory  practicals 
and workshops will be used to develop skills in hypothesis formation, data collection, analysis 
and  interpretation. There  is  an  emphasis  on  problem  solving  and  case  studies  to  develop 
analytical skills and to enhance integration and application of knowledge.  Research skills are 
a thread running through the programme but taught formally in BIO2005 in year 2.  Students 
are introduced to quantitative and qualitative research skills with an emphasis on data analysis 
so that they can critically evaluate different types of data presented in journals and be prepared 
for  the  dissertation  in  year  3. The  dissertation  module  affords  an  opportunity  to  develop  a 
particular area of interest or expertise in more depth.  
Individuals learn in different ways by providing a range of teaching and learning strategies we 
hope to maximise student potential.  
Autonomous  learning  means  that  students  have  responsibility  for  and  the  opportunity  to 
manage and be more independent in their own learning.  Modules are designed so that they 
provide a framework in the form of learning outcomes so that students are aware of what they 
need  to  learn  and  by  what  stage  of  their  programme.    Appropriate  learning  materials  and 
resource based materials will also support independent learning.  Students will be encouraged 
to  complete  a  PDP  (Personal  Development  Portfolio).    This  has  been  designed  to  assist 
students  to  take  responsibility  for  their  own  learning  and  to  act  as  a  record  of  continuing 
----------------Page (18) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 20 
 
 
personal and professional development which will be a useful adjunct to the final award. It also 
provides the student with a convenient framework to record reflective observations.  
Students will be allowed to develop as autonomous learners by the provision of self-directed 
learning from year 1.  Self-directed learning will be introduced and overseen by programme 
tutors to facilitate skills in student self-management, information retrieval and self-reflection.  
The use of e-learning will be prominent in many taught modules and will often enable students 
to carry out learning at a time which suits them. Online learning quizzes, data retrieval, use of 
government  and  other  recognised  websites  are  all  examples  of  how  the  web  is  used  an 
electronic resource.  Many text books are available online and students have access rights 
through Middlesex Learning Resources and there are also a wide range of electronic journals. 
UniHub  is  accessible from  outside the  University.   Electronic  discussion boards  will  enable 
students to support each other on modules.   
Your tutors and UniHelp advisors will provide any support you may need whilst learning online.  
By  engaging  with  e-learning  you  will  also  be  developing  skills  which  are  essential  for  your 
learning and are also highly valued by employers. These include but are not limited to: working 
flexibly,   communication,   understanding   of IT,   team   working   and   creating   shared 
understandings based on quality resources and access to global expertise.   
Assessment methods  
Assessment is an integral part of learning and you may hear it referred to as formative or 
summative.  
Formative assessment is designed to give you feedback on your performance and how it 
can be improved.  As a result you will get detailed feedback on formative assessment but not 
a grade.  Formative assessment is an important part of the learning process and has been 
shown to help students improve both their grades and their learning style.  
Summative assessment is designed to measure the extent to which you have achieved the 
learning  outcomes  of  a  module  and  therefore  the  grade  you  will  be  awarded.    Learning 
outcomes are the specific skills and knowledge that you are expected to demonstrate as a 
result of taking a module.  Summative assessment should assess achievement of all learning 
outcomes in a secure, fair and accurate manner.  
Assessment may also involve self, peer or group approaches.  For example, you may be 
asked to self-assess your own work, indicating where you feel you have clearly demonstrated 
your  understanding  and  also  identifying  areas  where  can  see  you  have  room  to  improve.  
Assessment  may  also  be  a  peer  process where  students,  individually  or  as  groups,  offer 
feedback on one another’s work.  Group assessment may also be part of your programme 
where part of the assessment requires you to demonstrate your ability to work as part of a 
group and possibly receive a group mark.  
Individual  modules  set assessment  deadlines different  to  all  other  modules  as  much  as 
possible.  This is to enable the assessment load to be spread evenly across the academic 
year.    Where  assessment  is  achieved  through  laboratory  reports,  reports  are  normally 
submitted  two  weeks  after  the  completion  of  the  laboratory  and  the  grade  and  feedback 
returned to students within three weeks of submission.  In all cases the assessment calendar 
----------------Page (19) Break----------------

for  each  semester  will  be  available  at  the  start  of  the  semester  and  can  be  found  in  the 
individual module handbooks and your yearly assessment map at the end of this programme 
handbook.  An updated assessment map will be available on MyLearning.  
 
It is up to each student to plan the management of their assessment to meet the deadlines.  
Failure to complete assessment at Level 5 and Level 6 by the given deadline will result in a 
penalty  for  that  piece  of  work  (a  maximum  of  40%,  grade  16).    If  you  have  extenuating 
circumstances which have meant you cannot submit by the deadline, you can apply for an 
extension and there are details about how to do this in myUnihub.  
 
Please note that assessment deadlines do occasionally change and while every effort has 
been made to ensure this is correct at the time of publishing you should check your email and 
My Learning on UniHub so you are aware of any changes.  
 
Please  see  the  module  narratives  at  the  end  of  this  handbook  or  your  module 
handbooks  for  more  information  about  the  specific  learning  arrangements  for  your 
modules. 
Submission and receipt of assessment 
You will find all the deadlines for your first year assessment (both formative and summative) 
in  your  assessment schedule  given  to  you  during  induction  week  and  online  in  myUniHub.  
Instructions on how to submit your assessment is given in each module handbook but this will 
either be electronically via myUniHub or, for work which must be submitted in hard copy, in 
person at UniHelp in the Sheppard Library.  
Your module handbooks have the precise details of when and how to submit your coursework 
(but  this  will  be  either  electronically  via  myUniHub  or  in  person  at  the  UniHelp  desk  in  the 
Sheppard Library) and how you get a receipt confirming you have submitted it.  Please refer 
to these and contact your module leader if you have any queries.  
Exams 
Information  about  exams,  including  the  timetable  and advice  on  preparing  and  revising  is 
available on UniHub; unihub.mdx.ac.uk/study/exams  
Past  exam  papers,  if  available,  can  be  accessed  via  the My  Study area  of  UniHub: 
https://myunihub.mdx.ac.uk/web/home-community/mystudy  
If you are concerned about your exams then please book an appointment via UniHub to speak 
to a Student Achievement Officer: unihub.mdx.ac.uk/support/appointment or email your query 
to stachievement@mdx.ac.uk.  
Marking, second marking and moderation 
A sample of examination papers and coursework assignments are moderated internally by the 
module  tutors  with  the  programme  leader  and/or  Director  of  Programmes  (where  the 
programme leader is part of the module team). 
----------------Page (20) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 22 
 
 
All coursework and examinations that do not meet the pass grade are moderated to ensure 
that there is agreement on the grade.  After being marked all examination scripts are checked 
to ensure that marks’ totals are correct and all sections have been marked.  
 
A sample of coursework and examination scripts is available for moderation by the external 
examiner(s).  This is usually 10% of the work for the module.  In addition all failed assessments 
are seen by the external.  
 
All dissertation projects are double marked.  As a final check, the overall profile of marks for 
the module are examined internally and externally to ensure consistency of standards both 
within and between subjects or programmed, and against national higher education standards.  
 
Return of coursework 
You  are  expected  to  keep  a  copy  of  all  your  coursework  and  it  should  be  kept 
somewhere safe (for example on a memory stick).  As the marked copy of your work is not 
normally returned to you it is important you keep a copy so you can understand the feedback 
you get properly.  
Exam scripts are not returned to any student however you can obtain feedback on exam 
performance by contacting your module leader. 
External Examiners 
External Examiners are one way we assure the academic quality of your programme.  They 
are subject experts who help assure that your Middlesex award is comparable to that at other 
UK  universities  by  reviewing  the  programme  curriculum,  the  assessment  and  the  learning 
resources.  Among other things they approve all exam papers before they are taken, attend 
the assessment board and write a report at the end of the year.  You can obtain a copy of this 
report by contacting programme leader. 
IMPORTANT: It is inappropriate for you or any other student to make direct contact with 
an External Examiner.  The appeal and complaints systems exist to allow you to express any 
concerns you have, including the marks you have been given for your performance. 
You can read more about the role of External Examiners on UniHub:  
https://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/study/ensuring-quality/external-examiners  
 
Assessment Feedback 
Feedback on your assessment (both formative and summative) provides the opportunity for 
you to reflect and to use the feedback as the basis for learning and to improve your work.   
Feedback can take many forms and may be informal.  For example it may be given and 
discussed orally in the classroom, or it may be more formal and delivered in written or audio 
form from academic staff or fellow students.  Understanding your feedback is very important 
and to achieve this you are encouraged to discuss feedback with your peers and academic 
staff.  
Receiving feedback  on your  work  is  an  essential  and  important  part  of  learning  and  so  we 
provide  regular  opportunities  for formative  assessment,  the  purpose  of  which  is  to  get 
----------------Page (21) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 23 
 
 
detailed feedback on your performance so you get a regular update on how you are developing 
and to prepare you for any summative assessment. 
Feedback on summative assessment will be offered in a variety of forms and all your work will 
be marked and moderated in line with the Code of Assessment Practice which can be found 
in section M of the University Regulations: mdx.ac.uk/regulations 
You will normally be provided with feedback within 15 working days of the published 
submission date.  
Feedback on coursework 
Arrangements for feedback are made at a modular level but all students can expect to receive 
effective and efficient feedback on work that is assessed formatively and summatively.  
 
Once submitted and marked students receive feedback electronically via email or through their 
learning space.  Feedback will normally consist of an assessment feedback sheet with written 
comments  on  it  or  comments  associated  with  coursework  submitted  electronically  via 
UniHub/Turnitin.    This  will  also  give  an  indication  of  how  you  performed  in  relation  to  the 
assessment criteria. Students are therefore, reminded to read their feedback in order to help 
them  with  further  assessments.    Tutors  are  available  for  support  to  help  students  clarify 
feedback.   
 
Feedback on examinations 
Arrangements are made at a module level.  Once the examination is undertaken and marks 
published,  students  can  collect  their  feedback  form.  This  will  in  general  be  an  individual 
feedback sheet or generic feedback for example the module team may provide an example 
written answer, tutorial or other information indicating expected answers for the examination.  
 
Comments on examination scripts and marks can be made on the examination script to 
facilitate marking of the paper and to assist the external examiner. 
 
Viewing scripts 
If you want to see your scripts you must arrange this through your tutor within 14 days of the 
release  of  results.    Please  note  that  on  occasion  scripts  are  sent  to  the  external  examiner 
during this period.  Alternative arrangements will be made in this instance.  
Dissertations/projects 
The   dissertation/project   supervisor   is   the   first   marker.      The   module   leader   for   the 
dissertation/project module appoints a second marker usually but not always within the field 
of expertise for the project work.   
Projects are marked “blind” and therefore marking is independent.  The grades from the two 
markers are moderated to finalise the overall grade.

Progressing on your Programme 
 
Re-assessment 
Although  no  one  anticipates  failing  a  module,  it  is  important  that  you  are  aware  of  what 
happens if you do.  Normally you would be entitled to one re-assessment opportunity if you 
don’t pass and there is no financial cost associated with this second attempt. You  should 
however consult the Your Study area on UniHub for more information:  
http://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/study/assess/progression.  
 
Deferral of assessment 
If there are exceptional circumstances which through no fault of your own are preventing you 
from  completing  all  or  some  of  your  assessment  (e.g.  submitting  coursework  or  taking  an 
exam)  you  may  seek  permission to  defer  the  relevant  assessment  to  the  next  available 
opportunity.  If you think this applies to you then you should first read the full Deferral Policy 
which  is  available  in  the  Assessment  and  Regulations  section  of  the  Your  Study  area  on 
UniHub: http://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/study/assess/Deferral. 
 
Deferral  requests  should  be  submitted  to  UniHelp  by  completing  the  relevant  form  and 
attaching supporting documentation, e.g. medical certificates.  The final deadline for deferral 
applications is 2 weeks after the end of the exam period (the dates of which are in the 
academic  calendar  at  the  start  of  this  handbook).  The  deferral  form  is  available  from  the 
Admin and Finances section of myUniHub:  
https://myunihub.mdx.ac.uk/web/home-community/myadminandfinances.   
 
If you have any questions about deferrals please contact UniHelp. 
If  you  have  difficulties  accessing  resources  after  deferral  (e.g.  accessing  the  University 
network  and UniHub)  then  contact UniHelp: http://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/unihelp by  phone  (+44 
208 411 6060), in person at the Sheppard Library or by email (unihelp@live.mdx.ac.uk). 
Results Confirmation 
At  the  end  of  each  academic  year,  module  grades  are  considered  and  confirmed  by  an 
Assessment Board. Following the Board, individual results and your progression status will be 
released after the point, and will be made available in the My Study area on MyUniHub. 
If any of your results are provisional they will be labelled as such. Further information on your 
results and assessment can be found in the University Guide, under the Your Study area of 
MyUniHub, or by seeking advice from your Progression and Support Team Officer. Further 
details can also be found in the University regulations. 
Academic Misconduct 
You  should  be  aware  of  the  Universities  academic  misconduct  policies  and  procedures. 
Taking unfair advantage over other students in assessment is considered a serious offence 
by the University. Action will be taken against any student who contravenes the regulations 
through negligence, foolishness or deliberate intent. Academic misconduct is a corrosive force 
----------------Page (23) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 25 
 
 
in the academic life of the University; it jeopardises the quality of education and devalues the 
degrees  and  qualifications  of  the  University. Academic  misconduct  takes  several  forms,  in 
particular: 
 Plagiarism – using extensive unacknowledged quotations from, or direct copying of, 
another person’s work and presenting it for assessment as if it were your own effort. 
This includes the use of 3rd party essay writing services. 
 Collusion – working together with other students (without the tutors permission), and 
presenting similar or identical work for assessment. 
 Infringement of Exam Room Rules – Communication with another candidate, taking 
notes to your table in the exam room and/or referring to notes during the examination. 
 Self-Plagiarism – including any material which is identical or substantially similar to 
material  that  has  already  been  submitted  by  you  for  another  assessment  in  the 
University or elsewhere. 
 
Full details on academic misconduct and the support available can be found here.  
Extenuating Circumstances 
Extenuating   Circumstances   are   personal   circumstances   which   have   affected   your 
performance in assessment and are brought to the attention of the Assessment Board when 
considering your academic performance. 
For  information  about  how  to  apply  for  Extenuating  Circumstances  please  see  information 
available on MyUniHub. 
Attendance 
Middlesex  University  is  keen  to  support  all  students  to  help  enhance  their  academic 
potential.  One of the ways we can do this is by monitoring attendance which will allow us to 
work with you to resolve issues that may prevent you from attending.  
Studies have shown that a good attendance record has a positive impact on performance and 
therefore  is  an  important  factor  in  helping  you  to  fulfil  your  academic  potential. If  your 
attendance is unsatisfactory, we will review your complete record.  
If  you  experience  difficulties  beyond  your  control,  which  prevent  you  attending,  you  should 
notify your tutor who may be able to offer support and guidance. The University Regulations 
(C2.1)   state every student must attend those teaching sessions specified in the regulations 
governing the module/programme.  In addition, Student Finance England and the Home Office 
(in  the  case  of  international  students)  require  attendance  to  be  monitored.  Full  details  of 
attendance monitoring policies can be found here . 
Things you should know about attendance 
Your punctuality and attendance are important, not just for you but for your cohort and peers. 
If you are frequently late or your attendance falls below the required amount specified in your 
module handbooks your record will be reviewed. 
----------------Page (24) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20 
Page | 26 
 
 
 It is your responsibility to ensure your attendance is recorded and as a professional 
courtesy you should let your lecturer know if you are going to be, or have been 
absent.  
 If you consistently miss sessions you will be contacted by the Attendance Team or 
your tutor. 
 Students should therefore make sure they have their student card when attending 
sessions. 
You are expected to attend all timetabled teaching sessions and field trips.  If you fail to 
meet the attendance requirements to meet the learning outcomes of the module, you may be 
excluded from the assessment and be graded X (ineligible for assessment due to 
unsatisfactory attendance/participation).  You may be able to take the module again with 
permission from the Director of Programmes.  This would require you to pay the module 
registration fee.  
In some modules, especially those with seminars and laboratories, participation in the  
sessions is essential in order to achieve the learning for the module. Students who do not 
attend sufficiently may not be able to submit the relevant assessment for the module.  
Where a practical session is not attended, students cannot submit a laboratory report 
applicable to this session. A register of all laboratory sessions will be kept.  
You will find specific information about attendance in each module handbook.   
The full regulations regarding attendance are in Section C of the University Regulations: 
www.mdx.ac.uk/regulations  
For further guidance on attendance requirements please refer to the section on attendance 
which is available on UniHub: unihub.mdx.ac.uk/study/attend and in the University Guide.  
Late arrival 
Whilst it is recognised that there are valid reasons for late arrival to classes, arriving late is 
disadvantageous to yourself and other students:  
• You may disrupt the learning experience of all students.  
• You will miss the first part of the class when the learning outcomes of the class are 
outlined.  
• In case of practical classes, you will miss the health and safety instructions, so you 
would endanger your health or other students if you were allowed into the class. 
Consequently, a five minute limit is applied in laboratory-based practicals. Thus, if 
you arrive later than five minutes late you will not be permitted to enter the laboratory 
or to join the class.  
Therefore, you are expected to be punctual, arrive in advance of and settle before the 
schedule start of the class. If you arrive late for whatever reason and the classroom door is 
shut or the lecturer has started the class, please do not enter the class. This policy has been 
introduced at the request of both staff and students, and to protect the interest of the majority 
of students who arrive on time. Please note if you try to enter the class, the tutor has the 
right to ask you to leave. 
 
----------------Page (25) Break----------------

If you are late, you should go to library for private study and attend your next timetabled 
class. You cannot attend a different seminar/lab as it may be full.  
Health and Safety 
 
Information and advice regarding health, safety and welfare is available on Your Support 
Services page on UniHub: http://unihub.mdx.ac.uk/support/wellbeing/index.aspx  
You are required to work safely in laboratories. Details of how to do so are given in the 
Module Handbooks.  Assessments of risk are made for all schedule laboratory practical 
sessions and are made prior to all research projects.  
 
In practical classes, students must comply with laboratory rules and health and safety 
policies.  These are normally outlined at the start of each module and students are required 
to sign an agreement, confirming that they understand rules and policies and will comply 
with these.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategy  
The nature of mathematics learning is that it is cumulative, and so in order to complete this module successfully, students are expected to 
be actively and continuously involved in all the learning, teaching and assessment methods employed, to develop their appreciation of, and 
skills in, the application of mathematics. 
Each week a one-hour lecture will introduce key concepts. These will be developed in a two-hour workshop / lab session where practical 
examples will be used to introduce and clarify subjects and software used to expand and analyse topics. Students will work individually or in 
groups on given problems to develop a deep understanding of areas and their use in practice. 
The lab time will introduce students to Excel and other suitable software to help them make practical use of the subjects covered in the 
module, and also to enhance their computing skills. 
 
Assessment Scheme 
Formative assessment will be given in the form of problems at the end of the lectures which students will work on in preparation for the 
workshop and laboratory session; students will be given immediate formative feedback on their work. 
The summative assessment of this module is task based. The learning outcomes have been decomposed into numerous milestones which 
are demonstrable during the lifetime of the module. 
----------------Page (40) Break----------------
BSc MComp/Computer Science 2019/20  
 
 
Student progress on demonstrating these milestones will be continually assessed during all student contact opportunities. Full details of the 
milestones and how they can be demonstrated will be given at the start of the module. Students and staff will be able to monitor progress of 
the achievement of these throughout the year. 
Summative assessment requires students to demonstrate that they have met all learning outcomes, and is entirely assessed by a series of 
tasks completed during the taught sessions. The tasks are selected in order to ensure students demonstrate an overall understanding of 
relevant concepts and techniques, and the ability to apply them.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies 
Learning and teaching strategy: 
 
In  the  year  prior  to  the  industrial  placement  year,  students  will  be  introduced  to  the  aims  of  the  module  and  given  guidance  on  appropriate  placement 
opportunities.  If a student decides to take a placement year, s/he must register with the designated placement officer and inform them the type of organisation 
they are interested in. The registered student will also be introduced to the health and safety aspects of placements. 
Students will book themselves for a CV workshop with the student development unit service, a preparation week prior to the placement starting. Students 
will also meet with the module leader for preparation prior to the placement commencing. 
Students are expected to apply reflective learning to their placement activities throughout the placement.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies 
A combination of weekly lectures and practical sessions will be used to deliver conceptual material and to allow students to develop 
practical skills.  
(a) Formative Assessment Scheme  
Students’ knowledge and skills will be assessed across a range of team and individual work and, written work based on practical work 
undertaken. To achieve this, a formative assessment strategy will be utilised to provide continuous feedback to students on their individual 
learning and progress. The process of formative assessment will lead to summative assessment, which will have two components.

(b) Summative Assessment Scheme 
For this module, there is a single summative coursework with three phases. CW Phase 1: User Research (LO 1, 2 and 4) CW Phase 2: 
Design & prototyping (LO 2,3 and 5) CW Phase 3: Evaluation (LO 3 and 4) Each phase is assessed by a group presentation AND an 
individually written report. In each written report, the student should identify their group members with an estimate of each contribution. This 
may be considered in the marking process. Note that each phase builds on the one before, so students who do not complete earlier phases 
will find it difficult to complete later ones. Formative assessment will be by tutor feedback on assessed components and by tracking 
progress in class.

 History of Open Source  
 Definitions of Open Source  
 Collaborative development model (source code management, bug tracking, communication methods)  
 Licensing and legal issues  
 Open Source business models  
 Ethical considerations  
 Open Source and politics 
 Active Development 
Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies  
The topics enumerated above will be discussed in a weekly lecture.  
Students will be required to participate in an existing project. Since the focus is not specifically on the quality of the end product, but on the 
interaction with the project community, this does not necessarily involve programming, but can also take the form of advocacy, adding to 
documentation, translation, etc. Creativity is encouraged.    
In order to encourage students to work on the project participation during the entire module run, they will be required to submit a blog about 
their progress each week. 
Knowledge of the Open Source background will be assessed using quizzes.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategy  
The module will be taught in a laboratory environment with hands-on activities, supported by lab demonstration, tutorial input and guided 
study.  
Assessment will be entirely by coursework assessing all learning outcomes  in the form undertaken as part of a team project, undertaken in 
ways that support the development of good practice and employability skills.  
Formative assessment will be embedded in this approach. For example, students will present, discuss and critique design ideas, and staff 
will contribute to this process. Formal and informal code reviews will provide feedback to students, but also require them to reflect on their 
systems in ways that are both deep and useful. Students will be required to justify design decisions prior to implementation, illustrating, for 
example, that systems are safe, live and fair in their behaviour. This embedding of professional methods of systems review into the learning 
process will also serve to ensure that each individual contributes to the development, and potential problems (such as plagiarism or poor 
participation) are identified and discussed with individuals as the projects develop.  
Summative assessment consists of a number of tasks and projects. The projects are designed so that students are required to demonstrate 
all 6 learning outcomes for successful completion. The precise details of the project will vary from year to year taking into account factors 
such as the students’ interests, the research specialisms of the staff involved and possible industrial involvement. Consequently the 
deliverables used as the basis for assessment will also change, but will be made explicit to students prior to the start of the module. For

example, a large, complex system-of-systems project undertaken by the whole cohort as one group would not be assessed in the same way 
as a challenge to propose a solution to a specific problem undertaken by small groups who “pitch” to a company.  
Typical elements of the assessment would include: 
 A presentation of the working system either in person or as a recorded artefact. 
 A presentation of the system design, including discussion of the key decisions taken and the rationale behind these. 
 A record of the details of the implementation, including code, plans, data sheets etc. 
 A personal submission by each student that is designed to enable individual grades to be decided. This might take the form of a 
reflective log, incorporating aspects of the design process monitoring above. It might also include a viva voce examination based 
upon other submitted items, to ensure that individual students understand, and contributed to, the work done.

Aims  
 
This module provides you with the opportunity of choosing and working on a project that reflects your interests and aims and outcomes of 
your programme. It should constitute a practical problem-solving project relevant to your programme of study. The primary aim of the 
module is to consolidate and deepen your understanding of material taught on your programme, to exercise professional judgement, to 
undertake individual research and to conduct an investigation and/or develop a product, process or application relevant to the focus of your 
programme. It provides you with the opportunity of engaging in significant system development, the typical output of which represents the 
solution of a problem akin to those that you as a fledgling professional practitioner are likely to encounter in future employment. The module 
intends that your choice of individual project will provide you with a significant opportunity to reflect on your learning progress and to 
develop your learning for life-long and career development.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategy  
 Supervisors will confirm the following:  
 
Agreed project proposal  
Student attended supervisory meetings  
Project delivery plan  
Suitability for BCS accreditation  
Guidelines, including submission deadlines, for each of these components of assessment will be detailed in the module handbook.      
Coursework 100%, with the following four deliverable components:  
Project proposal - 10%  
 Review/analysis/agreed work chapter - 20%  
 Final report - 45% 
Oral exam/demonstration - 25% 
Guidelines, including submission deadlines, for each of these components of assessment will be detailed in the module handbook.  
Students are expected to produce an artefact. The nature of this artefact will be determined by the programme of study and the supervisor 
with moderation from the module leader. For example, in programmes where software development plays a significant role, the artefact 
might be expected to be a piece of software. It might be the evaluation and modelling of a network or a novel visualisation of data. Extended 
literature reviews are not acceptable as student projects, however, they might form a significant part of some projects where analysis of 
literature leads to a set of heuristics or new ways of modelling data. The project work should not be an extension of student’s existing or 
previous coursework.
